1) Why waste gases like methane should not be let out
into the atmosphere:
Flammable
2) Explain why wrapping the beaker in cotton wool after it
has been heated will improve the accuracy of the results
obtained
insulation / reduces heat loss 1
temperature remains (more) constant / changes less / does not change / is maintained

3) Why is burette better?
More accurate in measuring volume than measuring cylinder
Meausring cylinder is better than pipette - Pippette is slow to add
Burettes measure variable volumes> Pipettes - volume isn’t fixed using a pipette
4) results of the experiment would change when the
experiment is repeated using a 250cm3 beaker in place of
the 100cm3 beaker:
Times shorter, less depth to look through
5) How to do a flame test
use of a wire / splint to get substance into a flame
2 putting sample INTO flame and identifying (Bunsen) flame as roaring / blue / non-luminous /
hot
6) Why is hot water used
- X dissolves faster

7)Reliability of results: repeat and compare results
8) Why stir the mixture?
- To react
- So that the temperature is the same throughout the mixture

- So that the reactants mix together
9) Describe how a Bunsen burner is adjusted to make the
flame as hot as possible.
air hole (fully) open
10) Why smthg isnt rinsed
used with same solution/ solution not changed

11) Suggest why the first few bubbles of gas are not
collected.
- It is air :(
12) State why the conical flask is swirled
- To mix reactants

13)Explain why it is not possible to use a volumetric
pipette to measure the volume
volume used is not fixed / volume needed is not the same in each experiment.

14) Reason for running the acid out of the burette
to make sure the level of the hydrochloric acid is on the scale.
o fill tap / to fill part of burette below tap

15) Why is burette rinsed with another solution after
water?
To remove water

16) Explain why air is collected in the measuring
cylinder.
Displaced by gas formed (ie co2)
Doesn’t affect accuracy of results because volume of air displaced = volume of C02
