Zoom in: pick one detail, make it symbolic, and describe it in depth. This could be a good opportunity for an extended metaphor.
Change perspective: imagine the scene through the eyes of somebody who is there-what are they feeling?
Zoom in again: pick another symbolic detail to describe in depth. Pick something contrasting to your earlier symbol.
Emotional ending: finally circle back to something mentioned in your opening paragraph, highlighting the emotional atmosphere.
