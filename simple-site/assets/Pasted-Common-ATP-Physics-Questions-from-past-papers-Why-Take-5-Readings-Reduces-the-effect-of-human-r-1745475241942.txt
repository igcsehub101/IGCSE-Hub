Common ATP Physics Questions (from past papers)
Why Take 5 Readings?
Reduces the effect of human reaction time error.


Spreads error over a longer duration.


Increases accuracy by taking an average.


Trial Reading
To check if the dependent variable is measurable.


Ensures the range of distance (d) and time (t) values is suitable.



Load and Scale
Horizontal Scale Setup
Measure the distance from the rule to the bench at both ends and adjust until equal.


Positioning Load on Metre Rule
Suspend the load using a loop of thread for accurate placement.


Common Errors
Metre rule may not be uniform.


Test load might not be exactly × N.


Top pan balance accurate only to the nearest gram.


Measuring Pendulum Length Accurately
View scale perpendicularly to avoid parallax error.


Use a set square for alignment.


Measure from the bottom of the clamp.


For spherical bobs: measure to top and add half the diameter.


Why It's Hard to Get Accurate Readings
Masses can slide or may not balance exactly.


Measuring Time for Oscillations
Use a fiducial point (fixed reference point) to help count 10 oscillations precisely.



Temperature
Accurate Temperature Readings
Line of sight must be perpendicular to the thermometer scale.


Stir the water to ensure uniform temperature throughout the container.


Keeping the Rate of Cooling Constant
Keep these factors the same:


Volume of water


Initial temperature


Container height, diameter, and surface area


Room temperature


Reducing Thermal Energy Loss
Use:


Insulation


Lid


Smaller surface area


Stopper (if applicable)


Avoiding Parallax Error
Take readings at right angles to the scale.


Reading a Measuring Cylinder
Always read from the bottom of the meniscus.


Ensure the cylinder is on a horizontal surface.


Measuring Volume Accurately
Large graduations in a 75 cm³ container can cause inaccuracy — use finer scales if possible.


Investigating Cooling Rate
Continue recording temperature as it approaches room temperature (r.t.p) over a long time to observe trends.




Ray Trace
Errors:
Pins are thick.
Hard to align pins.



Precautions:
Thin pencil.


View bottom of pin.


Large pin separation.


Thin pins.


Vertical pins.


How to make it reproducible:
Repeat with optical pins.



Electricity
Difficulties in resistance experiments:
Connection of crocodile clips.


Difficult to measure wire to nearest mm.


Readings between marks.




Variable Resistors
Pros:
Continuous set of values.


More values of resistance/current.


Easy to change current/resistance.


Prevent resistance wire getting hot → Reduce emf of power supply.

Lens
Dark room.


Lens, object, and screen perpendicular to bench / vertically upright.


Clamp the bend.


Translucent screen.
