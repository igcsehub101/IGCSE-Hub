
Under the science subheading, write and format the following info under the correct headings:

General advice (exam prep) “
Review important notes 
Use our checklist to ensure you have covered all the topics in the syllabus
Review the hard questions”


Paper 2
“Review hardest MCQs and method to solve them
Go over the syllabus doc
Bio - revise the colour of the indicators, important diagrams
Chem - revise the cation/anion/gas tests”

Paper 4
“Memorize definitions from the syllabus doc
Revise key words required by reviewing mark schemes 
Practice past papers by timing yourself and marking yourself
Make your own formula sheet to ensure you know all the formulas”


Paper 6

“Biology
Experiment
independent , dependent and control variable
Method
Safety precautions 
Repeat experiment 3 times and find average 

drawing question:
Use a sharp HB pencil.
Draw a clear and similar shape.
Avoiding shading
Draw according to the magnification asked in the paper.

Line graph: when say ‘passing through points’ or ‘suitable graph’ or ‘when there is time as variable’. It can be a straight (best fit line) or smooth curve.

Physics

Experiment: 
Include all pointers in the question
Add the units in the table
Additional points:
at least 5 sets of data taken  
repeat for each value of independent variable and take average  


Chemistry 
Taking measurements from burette/measuring cylinder - correct to 3 significant figures
Underline important information in experiments 
Always draw a smooth line graph”

Under the economics subheading type and format the following info under the correct headings
Paper 1 

“Revise the formulas for CPI, PED, PES
Go over the graphs for supply and demand, PPCs, currency, and the firm graphs ie fixed costs , average costs
Time and solve past papers”

Paper 2

“Format of answers:
4 markers: 2 knowledge points, 2 analysis points
8 markers: 
Structure: 2 body paragraphs, one for and against the question
For each body paragraph, 3 or 4 knowledge points and 2/ 3 analysis points 

Read mark schemes of hard questions
Revise important notes
Revise keywords and definitions 
Macroeconomic questions - connect points to macroeconomic aims
6 and 8 markers - take points from every chapter - link to micro and macroeconomics
8 markers - link each point back to the question”

Time management

“for each question, answer the sub-questions in reverse order: ie 8 6 4 2”

Under the computer science subheading, write and format the following information under the correct suv headings 

Paper 2
“15 marker 
Write the comments as you write the code
Revise the different types algorithms- linear search, bubble sort
Revise the loop structures: for, while and repeat
Revise the syntax for pseudocode statements”

Paper 1
“Revise from the mark schemes for key terms
Practice drawing diagrams for different concepts such as https, cyberattacks, blockchain, types of transmission 
Practice conversions between denary, hexadecimal and binary”
